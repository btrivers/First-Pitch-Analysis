## ðŸ“– Overview
This project investigates whether the first pitch of an MLB at-bat is statistically more likely to be a strike or a ball, and which pitch types are most effective at generating first-pitch strikes.

The analysis challenges traditional baseball strategy that encourages hitters to "take the first pitch" by providing data-driven evidence to reevaluate this approach.

## ðŸ“Š Data Description
- **Observations:** ~200 first-pitch samples  
- **Variables:**  
  - `Result` â€” Pitch outcome (`K` = strike, `B` = ball)  
  - `Pitch` â€” Pitch type (e.g., 4-Seam Fastball, Sinker, Curveball, Slider)  

Data were manually collected from ESPNâ€™s play-by-play logs of Baltimore Orioles games.

## ðŸ§® Statistical Methods
- One-sided binomial test to evaluate strike vs. ball proportions  
- Grouped pitch-type strike rate analysis (`K_rate`)  
- Visualizations created using `ggplot2`

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- First pitches are **significantly more likely** to be strikes than balls (p < 0.05).  
- **Fastballs** and **sinkers** show the highest first-pitch strike percentages.  
- Results suggest hitters may benefit from increased first-pitch aggressiveness.
